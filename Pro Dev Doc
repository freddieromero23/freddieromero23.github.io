	<!-- Google Yourself -->
	<h3>What I learned on Google?</h3>
<p>I need to delete an old MySpace account. I'm still featured on the SHC website as a courtesy monitor at one of their properties. I worked for them a short while prior to the start of the bootcamp.

<!-- Self-Worth Questions -->
<h3!>Self-Worth Questions</h3>
<!--ol>
	<li><strong>What are internal and external factors keeping you from achieving your goal?</strong> - A fear of failure and of working in professional fields without any pedigree to back it.</li>
	<li><strong>How do you personally create value for others?</strong> - I create value for others by optimizing their time, their understanding of subject matter while keeping it all organized so they don't have to think much, or rather they can put on the polishing touches.</li>
	<li><strong>Has anyone ever told you that you have potential, professionally speaking? Do you believe it? Why, why not?</strong> - At times I am insecure when people tell me I am good at something. I am learning to accept and embrace the skills identified to me as strengths.</li>

<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
<br>
<h3>Week 1</h3>
<p> This bootcamp is intense and I'm not sure if I'm capable of grasping key concepts to be successful. This weekend I'm going to review everything we've learned and read through the chapters we've covered.
</p>
<h3>Week 2</h3>
<p>
	've finally settled into a rhythm and, well still a bit unsettled, I've become comfortable with that feeling thanks to some helpful advice along the way. 
 </p>
<!--h3>Week 3</h3>
<p>Last week went fast. I only had three days to finish all my normal work and then we had two days of off-stie training about HyperLedger. It was wonderful. I got to try my first time at Ubuntu Linux and coding in Ethereum.</p>
<h3>Week 4</h3>
