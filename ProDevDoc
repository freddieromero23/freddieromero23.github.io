	<h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
	<p><strong>Version 1</strong></p>
	<p>How's it going? My name is Freddie. I'm a student learning to develop applications utilizing Java. I'm currently enrolled at CNM and attending their Java, Android and Salesforce coding bootcamp. It's an intensive program that I'm working through in order to be to provide my daughter a secure future. Are you hiring developers?
	</p>
	<!--><strong>Version 2</strong></p>
	<p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Aliquam laoreet viverra metus vitae scelerisque. Nunc varius augue sem, tincidunt pellentesque est ultricies a. Aliquam id. 
	</p>

	<!-- Google Yourself -->
	<h3>What I learned on Google?</h3>
<p>I need to delete an old MySpace account. I'm still featured on the SHC website as a courtesy monitor at one of their properties. I worked for them a short while prior to the start of the bootcamp.
 </p>

 <h3>How I develop my whole brain?</h3>
<p>How I develop my whole brain? Outside of attending an intensive bootcamp? While I'm not exactly sure how to answer this question, I suppose the simple answer is being a father. Nothing tests your knowledge more than an intelligent and curious child. I read nightly to my daughter and have her read to me, while fielding any questions she brings up. We also create games, stories and artwork together. Basically, I believe a parent is a child's first and most important teacher and this motivates me to consistently step out of my comfort zone, so that she is inspired to learn through our play. This has the side-effect of learning a variety of new things myself.

<!-- Self-Worth Questions -->
<!-->Self-Worth Questions</h3>
<!--ol>
	<li><strong>What are internal and external factors keeping you from achieving your goal?</strong> - A fear of failure and of working in professional fields without any pedigree to back it.</li>
	<li><strong>How do you personally create value for others?</strong> - I create value for others by optimizing their time, their understanding of subject matter while keeping it all organized so they don't have to think much, or rather they can put on the polishing touches.</li>
	<li><strong>Has anyone ever told you that you have potential, professionally speaking? Do you believe it? Why, why not?</strong> - At times I am insecure when people tell me I am good at something. I am learning to accept and embrace the skills identified to me as strengths.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Weekly Reflections</h2>
<br>
<h3>Week 1</h3>
<p> This bootcamp is intense and I'm not sure if I'm capable of grasping key concepts to be successful. This weekend I'm going to review everything we've learned and read through the chapters we've covered.
</p>
<h3>Week 2</h3>
<p>
	I've finally settled into a rhythm and, well still a bit unsettled, I've become comfortable with that feeling thanks to some helpful advice along the way.
